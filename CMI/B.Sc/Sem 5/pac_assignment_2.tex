		%Solution
		Let $C\in NC^1$. Let depth of $C$ is denoted by $d$ and size is denoted by $d$. Since the circuit is in $NC^1$ we can assume the circuit has fanin 2. Since $C$ has fanin 2 and depth $d$ $s$ can be atmost $2^d$. We will show we can convert $C$ into a formula of at most size $2^d$ and depth $d$.
		
		We will unveil the circuit from the top and go towards bottom. For any depth level $i$ if for any $k$ many gates there is a common child gate then we make $k$ many copies of that child gate, one for each gate at depth level $i$ and each of that child gate remains at depth $i-1$, so that each child gate has fanout 1. At depth $i$ maximum number of gates is $2^{d-i}$. So at max with this process of unveiling at depth $i$ we twice the gates in $C$. So at each depth we at most twice the gates. After the process So at max the size will be after the process is $O(2^{O(d)}s)$. Since $d=O(\log n)$ so size becomes $O(n^{O(1)}s)=poly(n)$. Hence in $NC^1$ circuits and formulas are equivalent.

		Prove that $TC^0\subseteq NC^1$ using Redundant Algebra
	\end{problem}
	
	\solve{
		%Solution
		Let us denote the addition of two $n$ bit numbers using redundant algebra is denoted by $ADDR$. Now we have showed that $ADDR\in NC^0$. Now we will first reduce addition of 3 $n$-bit numbers to addition of 2, $(n+1)$-bit numbers. Let $a,b,c$ are 3, $n$-bit numbers. where $a=a_{n-1}\dots a_1a_0$, $b=b_{n-1}\dots b_1b_0$ and $c=c_{n-1}\dots c_1c_0$ where each $a_i,b_j,c_k\in\{0,1\}$. Nowwe can construct two numbers $x$ and $y$ each having $(n+1)$-bits where $$x_i=a_i\oplus b_i \oplus c_i\text{ and }y_i=(a_{i-1}\wedge b_{i-1})\vee (b_{i-1}\wedge c_{i-1}) \vee (c_{i-1}\wedge a_{i-1})\quad \forall \ 0\leq i\leq n-1,\ y_0=0$$Now $x+y=a+b+c$. So we have reduced the addition of3, $n$-bit numbers to addition of 2, $(n+1)$-bit numbers, which is in $NC^0$ using redundant algebra. Hence
