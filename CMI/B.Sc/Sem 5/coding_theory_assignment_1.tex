	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item Since $G$ has full rank, $rank(G)=k$. Therefore in the reduced column echelon form of $G$ the first $k$ columns forms a identity matrix $I_k$. We denote the matrix formed by the rest $n-k$ columns by $A$. Since the reduced column echelon form of a matrix and the matrix generate the same vector space they are equivalent. And since the reduced column echelon form can be obtained through the Gaussian elimination method we can convert $G$ to a matrix $G'$ of the form $G'=[I_k|A]$ in polynomial time where $G'$ and $G$ are equivalent.
		\item We should have $GH^T=0$ where $G$ is of the form $G=[I_k|A]$. where $A$ is a $k\times (n-k)$ matrix. Take $H=[-A^T|I_{n-k}]$. Suppose we denote $G=(g_{i,j})_{\substack{1\leq i\leq k\\ 1\leq j\leq n}}$ and $H=(h_{i,j})_{\substack{1\leq i\leq n\\ 1\leq j\leq n-k}}$.  Let $C=GH^T=(c_{i,j})_{\substack{1\leq i\leq k\\ 1\leq j\leq n-k}}$\begin{align*}
			c_{i,j}&=\sum_{m=1}^ng_{i,m}h_{m,j}=\sum_{m=1}^{k}\delta_{i,m}h_{m,j}+\sum_{m=k+1}^ng_{i,m}\delta_{m-k,j}=h_{i,j}+g_{i,k+j}=-a_{i,j}+a_{i,j}=0
		\end{align*}So we get every entry of $C$ is 0. Hence $GH^T=0$. Therefore $H$ is the parity check matrix of $G$ and since $H$ is of the form $H=[-A^T|I_{n-k}]$ so it has full rank $n-k$. Hence $H$ is a parity check matrix.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We have $f(X+Z)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{t} r_i(X)Z^i$. Now differentiating $f$ with respect to $Z$ we have $$f'(X+Z)=\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}(i+1)r_{i+1}(X)Z^i$$
		Let for $n=k-1$ we have $$f^{(k-1)}(X+Z)=\sum_{i=0}^{t-k+1} \frac{(i+k-1)!}{i!} r_{i+k-1}(X)Z^i$$
		Denote $\dfrac{(i+k-1)!}{i!} r_{i+k-1}(X)=g_{i}(X)$. Then for $n=k$ we have
		\begin{align*}
			f^{(k)}(X+Z) & = \sum_{i=0}^{t-k} (i+1)g_{i+1}Z^i=\sum_{i=0}^{t-k} \frac{((i+1)+k-1)!}{i!} r_{(i+1)+k-1}(X)Z^i\\
			& = \sum_{i=0}^{t-k}\frac{(i+k)!}{i!} r_{i+k}(X)Z^i
		\end{align*}
		Hence by mathematical induction we have $$f^{(n)}(X+Z)=\sum_{i=0}^{t-n}\frac{(i+n)!}{i!} r_{i+n}(X)Z^i$$
		Therefore $$f^{(n)}(X)=f^{(n)}(X+0)=\sum_{i=0}^{t-n}\frac{(i+n)!}{i!} r_{i+n}(X)0^i=\frac{n!}{0!}r_{n}(X)=n!r_n(X)$$
		\item Let $char(\bbF_q)=m$. So $j\geq m$. Hence $j!=j(j-1)\cdots (m+1)m(m-1)!=mk$ where $k=j(j-1)\cdots (m+1)(m-1)!$. Since $f^{(j)}(X)=j!r_j(X)=m\lt( kr_j(X) \rt)\equiv 0$.
