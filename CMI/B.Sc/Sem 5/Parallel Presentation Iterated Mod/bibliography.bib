	abstract = {The iterated mod problem is this: given a, b1, b2, ..., bn, all integers or all polynomials in Q[x], is ((...((a mod b1) mod b2)...) mod bn) = 0? When the inputs are integers, we prove the problem P-complete with respect to log-space reductions, whereas in the polynomial case, we prove the problem is in NC. The significance of these results lies primarily in the similarity between the iterated mod problem and the Euclidean algorithm. We also show that the superincreasing knapsack problem is P-complete, using a very similar proof.}
