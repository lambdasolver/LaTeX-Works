		%Solution
		Let $L_k$ denote the number of bits used to represent vertices at $k$-th iteration. Now for $i=1$ we have $$L_1=\lceil \log n\rceil+1\leq 2\lceil \log n\rceil$$Now let for $i=k-1$ we have $L_{k-1}\leq 2\lceil \log^{(k-1)}n\rceil$ and $\lceil \log^{(k)}n\rceil \geq 2$. Now \begin{align*}
			L_k&=\lceil \log L_{k-1}\rceil +1\leq \lt\lceil\log 2\lt[\log^{(k-1)}n\rt]\rt\rceil +1\leq 2\lt\lceil\log^{(k)}n\rt\rceil
		\end{align*}Hence if $\lceil\log^{(k)}n\rceil\geq 2$ we have $L_k\leq 2\lceil \log^{(k)}n\rceil$ Therefore the number of bits to represent the vertices decreases with each iteration and after $O(\log^*n)$ many iteration $L_k$ reaches the value of 3 (The limit $L$ of $\lim\limits_{k\to \infty}L_k=\lim\limits_{k\to \infty}\lceil\log L_{k-1}\rceil +1$ is the solution of $L=\lceil\log L \rceil +1$). In those 3 bits the $i_v$ takes 3 possible values and the $b_v$ takes 2 possible values for each vertex $v$. Hence total number of colors is $3\times 2=6$.

		%Problem	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Prove that every weakly connected component of a pseudoforest contains at most one cycle
			\item Find a 3 Coloring pseudoforest algorithm in $O(\log^*n)$ time
		\end{itemize}
	\end{problem}
	
	\solve{
		%Solution
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Suppose there are two cycles $C_1$, $C_2$ in a weakly connected component. Now $C_1$ and $C_2$ has to be disjoint cause other wise there will be a vertex in $CC_!\cap C_2$ from which two edges have gone out side one for the next vertex in $C_1$ and the other one for the next vertex in $C_2$. This is not possible since in a pseudoforest each vertex has out-degree exactly 1. So $C_1$ and $C_2$ are disjoint. Since they remain in same weakly connented component for $u\in C_1$ and $v\in C_2$ there exists a path $u\rightsquigarrow v$ or $v\rightsquigarrow u$. WLOG let the path $u\rightsquigarrow v$ exists. Let the path is $P$. Now there exists an edge $(x,y)=e\in P$ such that $e\notin C_1$ but the tail $x$ of the edge is in $C_1$. Now since $x\in C_1$ there is an edge going outward from $x$ towards the next vertex in $C_1$. And also the edge $(x,y)$ is going outwards along $P$. Hence out-degree of $x$ is at least 2. Which is not possible. Hence every weakly connected component of a pseudoforest has at most one cycle.
