		%Problem
	\parinn The \textit{Jordan curve theorem} asserts that every Jordan curve in the plane determines exactly two regions. The notion of winding number leads to a quick proof of one part of the theorem, namely that the complement of a Jordan curve $\gamma$ has at least two components. This will be so if there exists a point $a$ with $n(\gamma, a) \neq 0$.
	
	We may assume that $\Re (z)>0$ on $\gamma$, and that there are points $z_1$, $z_2 \in \gamma$ with $\Im (z_1)<0, \Im (z)_2>0$. These points may be chosen so that there are no other points of $\gamma$ on the line segments from 0 to $z_1$ and from 0 to $z_2$. Let $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ be the ares of $\gamma$ from $z_1$ to $z_2$ (excluding the end points).
	
	Let $\sigma_1$ be the closed curve that consists of the line segment from 0 to $z_1$ followed by $\gamma_1$ and the segment from $z_2$ to 0 , and let $\sigma_2$ be constructed in the same way with $\gamma_2$ in the place of $\gamma_1$. Then $\sigma_1-\sigma_2=\gamma$ or $-\gamma$. 
	
	The positive real axis intersects both $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ (why?). Choose the notation so that the intersection $x_2$ farthest to the right is with $\gamma_2$ (Figure). Prove the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item $n\left(\sigma_1, x_2\right)=0$, hence $n\left(\sigma_1, z\right)=0$ for $z \epsilon \gamma_2$;
		\item $n\left(\sigma_1, x\right)=n\left(\sigma_2, x\right)=1$ for small $x>0$ (Lemma 2);
		\item the first intersection $x_1$ of the positive real axis with $\gamma$ lies on $\gamma_1$;
		\item $n\left(\sigma_2, x_1\right)=1$, hence $n\left(\sigma_2, z\right)=1$ for $z \epsilon \gamma_1$;
		\item there exists a segment of the positive real axis with one end point on $\gamma_1$, the other on $\gamma_2$, and no other points on $\gamma$. The points $x$ between the end points satisfy $n(\gamma, x)=1$ or -1 .

	\end{problem}
	
	\solve{
		%Solution
		We have $|dz|=-i\rho \frac{dz}{z}$. Therefore \begin{align*}
			\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{|dz|}{|z-a|^2} & = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{z|z-a|^2}= -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{z(z-a)(\ovz-\ova)}\\
			& = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{(z-a)\lt(z\ovz-\ova z  \rt)}\\
			& = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{(z-a)\lt(\frac{\rho^2}{z}z-\ova z\rt)}\\
			& = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{(z-a)\lt(\rho^2-\ova z\rt)}
		\end{align*}
	
	Now if $\rho < |a|$, then $|z-a|^2>0$. Hence the function $\frac1{(z-a)\lt(\rho^2-\ova z\rt)}$ is analytic and its integral  along $|z|=\rho$ is 0
	
	If $\rho > |a|$ then if $\rho^2\neq \ova z$ because if it is then \begin{align*}
		\rho^2\neq \ova z \iff |z| =\frac{\rho^2}{|a|} \iff \rho = \frac{\rho^2}{|a|} \iff |a|=\rho
	\end{align*} which is not possible. Hence $f(z)=\frac{1}{\rho^2-\ova z}$ is analytic in the $\rho$-disk. Hence $$\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{\rho^2-\ova z}=0$$. Then by Cauchy's Integral Formula we have $$f(a)=\frac1{2\pi i}\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{f(z)dz}{z-a}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{(z-a)\lt(\rho^2-\ova z\rt)} \iff $$ Therefore we have $$\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{|dz|}{|z-a|^2} =-i\rho f(a)2\pi i=-i\rho \frac{2\pi i}{\rho^2-a\ova}=\frac{2\pi \rho}{\rho^2-a\ova}$$
