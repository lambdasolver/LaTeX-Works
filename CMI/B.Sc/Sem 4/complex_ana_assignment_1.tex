				Find the general analytic function $f=u+iv$, such that $u=x^2-y^2$.
	
		%Problem		
	\end{problem}
	
	\solve{
		%Solution
		Given that $u=x^2-y^2$. Then $\del{u}{x}=2x$ and $\del{u}{y}=-2y$. Since the function is analytic $u,v$ follows the Cauchy Riemann Equations. Hence $$\del{u}{x}=\del{v}{y}\qquad \del{u}{y}=-\del{v}{x}$$Hence $\del{v}{x}=2x$ and $\del{v}{y}=2y$. Now since $\del{v}{x}=2y$ we can assume $v=2xy+g(y)$ where $g$ is some real valued function. But then $\del{v}{y}=2x$ implies that $g'(y)=0$ hence $g$ is some constant function. Hence $v=2xy+c$ where $c\in \bbR$ some constant. Hence $$f(x,y)=x^2-y^2+i(2xy+c)==x^2-y^2+2ixy+ic=(x+iy)^2+ic\iff f(z)=z^2+ic$$

		%Problem
					Prove Cauchy's inequality: Let $a=(a_1,...,a_n)$, $b=(b_1,...,b_n)$ be two complex vectors, then $$( a\cdot b)^2 \leq \|a\|^2  \|b\|^2$$ where $(a\cdot b)$ is the scalar product of vectors.
				
	\end{problem}
	
	\solve{
		%Solution
		Consider the vector $a+\lm b$. Now since for any vector $v$, $\sqrt{(v\cdot v)}=\|v\|\geq 0$ we have $\sqrt{((a+\lm b)\cdot (a+\lm b))}\geq 0$. Now \begin{align*}
			((a+\lm b)\cdot (a+\lm b))  & = (a\cdot (a+\lm b))+\lm (b\cdot (a+\lm b))\\
			& = (a\cdot a)+\lm (a\cdot b)+\lm (b\cdot a)+\lm^2(b\cdot b)\\
			& \|a\|^2+2 \lm (a\cdot b) + \lm^2\|b\|^2
		\end{align*}
	Since $	((a+\lm b)\cdot (a+\lm b))  \geq 0$ the discriminant of the polynomial, $p(\lm)=\|a\|^2+2 \lm (a\cdot b) + \lm^2\|b\|^2$ is non-positive. Hence $$ 4(a\cdot b) ^2\leq 4\|a\|^2\|b\|^2\iff (a\cdot b) ^2\leq \|a\|^2\|b\|^2$$

		%Problem		
		If $g(w)$ and $f(z)$ are analytic functions, show that $g(f(z))$ is also analytic.

	\solve{
		%Solution
		Let $g(w)=u_g(x,y)+iv_g(x,y)$ and $f(z)=u_f(x,y)+iv_f(x,y)$. Then $u_g,u_f,v_g,v_f$ have continuous partial derivatives and satisfy Cauchy Riemann Equations.\begin{align*}
			\frac{\partial u_g}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v_g}{\partial y}\qquad\frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} \\
			\frac{\partial u_f}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v_f}{\partial y} \qquad \frac{\partial u_f}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial v_f}{\partial x}
		\end{align*} Then $$h(z)=u_h(x,y)+iv_h(x,y)=u_g(u_f(x,y),v_f(x,y))+iv_g(u_f(x,y),v_f(x,y))$$Therefore\begin{align*}
			 \del{u_h}{x}  = \del{u_g}{u_f}\del{u_f}{x}+\del{u_g}{v_f}\del{v_f}{x}&& \del{u_h}{y}  = \del{u_g}{u_f}\del{u_f}{y}+\del{u_g}{v_f}\del{v_f}{y}\\
			 \del{v_h}{x}  = \del{v_g}{u_f}\del{u_f}{x}+\del{v_g}{v_f}\del{v_f}{x} && \del{v_h}{y}  = \del{v_g}{u_f}\del{v_f}{y}+\del{v_g}{v_f}\del{v_f}{y}

		\end{align*}For $z^2$
	$$\del{u_1}{x}=2x=\del{v_1}{y}\qquad \del{u_1}{y}=-2y=-\del{v_1}{y}$$and for $z^3$ $$\del{u_2}{x}=3x^2-3y^2=\del{v_2}{Y}\qquad \del{u_2}{y}=-6xy=-\del{v_2}{x}$$Hence both the functions follow the Cauchy-Riemann's Equations

	\solve{
		%Solution
		If $|f(z)|=0$ $\forall\ z\in\bbC$ then we have $f(z)=0$. Now let $|f(z)|=c>0$ $\forall \ z\in \bbC$. Let $f=u+iv$ then $|f(z)|=\sqrt{u^2(x,y)+v^2(x,y)}=c$. Therefore \begin{align*}
			\del{}{x}(u^2+v^2)=2u\del{u}{x}+2v\del{v}{x}=u\del{u}{x}-v\del{u}{y}=0\\
			\del{}{y}(u^2+v^2)=2u\del{u}{y}+2v\del{v}{y}=u\del{u}{y}+v\del{u}{x}=0
		\end{align*}We can write this in matrix form that $$\mat{u & -v\\ v & u}\mat{\del{u}{x} \\ \del{u}{y}}=\mat{0\\ 0}$$Now if $\mat{u & -v\\ v & u}$ is not invertible then determinant=$u^2+v^2=0$ which is not possible then $\mat{\del{u}{x} \\ \del{u}{y}}=\mat{0\\ 0}$Hence all the partial derivatives of $f$ is 0. So $f'(z)=0$ or $f(z)=c$
